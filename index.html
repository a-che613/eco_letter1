            <p>We have finished developing several
              features for our platform, including the
              authentication feature for both owners
              and agents, the EcoPoints feature, the
              Book Now feature, and the Blog and Daily
              Tips feature. These features are now ready
              to be deployed and used by our users
            </p>

          <div>
            <p class="bold">...and here comes the new features.....</p>
            <p>This week, we plan to work on
              implementing these features next to
              improve the functionality and user
              experience of our platform: Notification
              feature, Owner Profile feature, Book Later
              and Recurrent Booking feature, Agent
              Tracking feature, Bidding feature, and
              Contact Us feature

            <p>For maintenance and
              scalability reasons, the idea of
              doing 2 separate apps for the
              Owners and Agents was
              considered. But due to other
              non-technical factors we are
              moving ahead with a single app
              both for users and agents.</p>

          <div class="div1b">
            <img src="images/dos-removebg-preview.png" alt="">
            <p>Since we want a more
              scalable and robust
              version of the app, the
              front-end and back-end
              architecture had to be
              changed entirely -
              affecting the initial timeline
              for the MVP Launch</p>
